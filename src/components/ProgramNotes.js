# Axamer Folio [2015]
_for saxophone and drumset_

Axamer Folio is a modular network of 24 pieces for saxophone and drumset, with no pre-set order,
form, or duration.
The individual pieces (which include duos, solos, and duos that can be separated and combined with
other pieces) project a small number of musical objects in an extremely diverse range of performative
and notational contexts, from rigorously specified to indeterminate, graphic, and text scores; from
tightly synchronized duo music to phasing loops, list structures, and free improvisation. The result is a
kind of self-similar labyrinth of possibilities, within which the performers trace a path.
Axamer Folio is dedicated to Anthony Braxton and mathias spahlinger.

**For Performers: Constructing a Version**

First, decide on the general overall duration: short [~7-9'], standard [~10-19'], or long [~20-25+'].

Then, start by making an initial selection of some of the modules you want in the version. No version can or will include all modules; it's up to the performers to choose what to include, and what to emphasize.

Third, begin to “build out” the form of the version, referring to the “routing” diagrams for each module. Each piece has a specific of set of modules that can precede it, and a set that it can move on to, so begin arranging your chosen modules according to these pathways.

Choose additional modules to connect these, as necessary, keeping in mind that modules that are “separable duos,” or ones can be played as individual solos, can overlap. In this case:

> – if both of the overlapping modules are “frame compatible,” a common meter and pulse can bemaintained across the duo, if desired. (For example, the saxophonist could begin INZIG after two pages of LANS, and the the two pieces would proceed together in the same tempo and
metrical structure.)

> – Or, the players can enter a period of asynchronization, and re-orient at a later point by means of a pre-arranged cue

Depending on the players' preference, a version may be almost entirely synchronized and precisely co-ordinated duo music, or there may be substantial periods of independence, free polyphony, improvisation, and solo playing.

A few more specific constraints...

## 1. Beginning and Ending
Any module or pair of modules can begin or end the piece, with the following exceptions:

– ARZL/THAUR/RINN, BIRGITZ, MIEDERS, and NEDER are non-initial, and can't begin a version;

– ARZL/THAUR/RINN, AXAMER-LIZUM, and KREITH/GRIES AM BRENNER are non-final, and can't end a version.

## 2. MEDRAZ
There is no module that all versions must include, but MEDRAZ is the most likely to occur, as it's connected to almost every other, the “central hub” of the routing network. By default MEDRAZ should be in any version; its exclusion should be a conscious, reasoned choice. When included, MEDRAZ is played either twice or three times, each with a separate tempo and “protocol” (as outlined on its title page), either distributed through the form, or played consecutively.

## 3. “Loop Circuit” Modules (ARZL, THAUR, RINN)
Any version over 10' long should include one of the “loop circuit” modules (ARZL, THAUR, or
RINN), though no version can contain more than one.

## 4. Repetition of Modules Within a Form
No module can be repeated within a version, except AXAMS, which can be played once or twice,
separated by other pieces. Modules that can be played as solos for either instrument (MIEDERS, NEDER) can be played twice if played by different players on each occasion.

## 5. Improvised/Fixed Modules
In the case of the modules with paired improvised versions (KREITH / GRIES AM BRENNER, GÖTZENS / PRAXMAR), only one or the other should be included in a version.
