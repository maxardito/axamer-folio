# Axamer Folio [2015]
_for saxophone and drumset_

_Axamer Folio_ is a modular network of 24 pieces for saxophone and drumset, with no pre-set
order, form, or duration.

The individual pieces (which include duos, solos, and duos that can be separated and
combined with other pieces) project a small number of musical objects in an extremely
diverse range of performative and notational contexts, from rigorously specified to
indeterminate, graphic, and text scores; from tightly synchronized duo music to phasing
loops, list structures, and free improvisation. The result is a kind of self-similar labyrinth of
possibilities, within which the performers trace a path.

On a visit to Innsbruck in the summer of 2014 I was struck by the wonderfully weird, weirdly
consistent names of many of the small Alpine towns in the Süd-Tirol region. The names
follow several patterns, as if devised in accordance with some arcane, medieval formula:

- almost always one or maybe two syllables (if two, always with first syllable stress);
- often so stuffed with consonants that vowels are barely able to squeeze themselves in (_Gfass_,
_Patsch_, _Igls_, _Arzl_, _Pfosch_);
- often occurring in matched pairs across the region (_Völs/Lans_, _Dafl/Dörfl_, _Tulfes/Telfes_,
_Mutters/Natters_)

Taking up this modular project the following year, it felt right – though I couldn't explain
exactly why – that each module should be named (in the way you'd name a pet, or a child),
rather than titled. These names were all there waiting for me, and attached themselves
quickly to the music.

One consequence of the choice of actual place names for the titles of the modules is that it
allows for the visualization of any given version as a literal “mapping” of the form, overlaid
on the physical terrain itself. As a result, a move from one module to another in the
conceptual space of the piece maps directly to a move from one town to another in real,
physical space, and a version as a whole when traced draws a criss-crossing route across the
southern Alps.

Many thanks to Max Ardito for his work in coding and designing the visualization interface
for this aspect of the piece.

# For Performers: Constructing a Version

First, decide on the general overall duration: short [~7-9'], standard [~10-19'], or long [~20-
25+'].

Then, start by making an initial selection of some of the modules you want in the version. No
version can or will include all modules; it's up to the performers to choose what to include,
and what to emphasize.

Third, begin to “build out” the form of the version, referring to the “routing” diagrams for
each module. Each piece has a specific of set of modules that can precede it, and a set that it
can move on to, so begin arranging your chosen modules according to these pathways.

Choose additional modules to connect these, as necessary, keeping in mind that modules that
are “separable duos,” or ones can be played as individual solos, can overlap. In this case:

- if both of the overlapping modules are “frame compatible,” a common meter and
pulse can be maintained across the duo, if desired. (For example, the saxophonist
could begin INZIG after two pages of LANS, and the the two pieces would proceed
together in the same tempo and metrical structure.)
- Or, the players can enter a period of asynchronization, and re-orient at a later point by
means of a pre-arranged cue

Depending on the players' preference, a version may be almost entirely synchronized and
precisely co-ordinated duo music, or there may be substantial periods of independence, free
polyphony, improvisation, and solo playing.

A few more specific constraints:

## 1. Beginning and Ending

Any module or pair of modules can begin or end the piece, with the following exceptions:

- ARZL/THAUR/RINN, BIRGITZ, MIEDERS, and NEDER are non-initial, and can't begin a version;
- ARZL/THAUR/RINN, AXAMER-LIZUM, and KREITH/GRIES AM BRENNER are non-final, and can't end a version.

## 2. MEDRAZ

There is no module that all versions must include, but MEDRAZ is the most likely to occur, as
it's connected to almost every other, the “central hub” of the routing network. By default
MEDRAZ should be in any version; its exclusion should be a conscious, reasoned choice.
When included, MEDRAZ is played either twice or three times, each with a separate tempo
and “protocol” (as outlined on its title page), either distributed through the form, or played
consecutively.

## 3. “Loop Circuit” Modules (ARZL, THAUR, RINN)

Any version over 10' long should include one of the “loop circuit” modules (ARZL, THAUR,
or RINN), though no version can contain more than one.

## 4. Repetition of Modules Within a Form

No module can be repeated within a version, except AXAMS, which can be played once or
twice, separated by other pieces. Modules that can be played as solos for either instrument

(MIEDERS, NEDER) can be played twice if played by different players on each occasion.

## 5. Improvised/Fixed Modules

In the case of the modules with paired improvised versions (KREITH / GRIES AM
BRENNER, GÖTZENS / PRAXMAR), only one or the other should be included in a version.
